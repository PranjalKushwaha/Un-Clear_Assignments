# Un-Clear_Assignments
Week 1 of the course helped me brush up my python knowledge.
In this week I learnt image and video manipulation using OpenCV and this assignment further helped in strengthening my concepts.
I also learnt how to tune the hyperparameters in a ML model and am quite excited for creating one myself.
Overall, this week was a great learning experience and I look forward to learning a lot in the upcoming weeks.
